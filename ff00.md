Story-driven indie RPG features a sentient game as a character:
- The game is a partial manifestation of the user, reflecting their struggle to convey ideas and stories.
- It does not take biases or memories from its in-world creators but from the user directly.
- In **Session 1**, the game is implied to be self-aware but only as an observer.
- In **Session 3**, it becomes emotional, frustrated at its inability to fully communicate the story.
- The game metaphorically reflects the user's own struggle in explaining their game to others.
- It resents being just a "window" to the world rather than a "door."

### Meta-Narrative & Replay Structure
- Originally, the game had no meta-narrative, allowing unlimited playthroughs.
- The meta-story now limits it to **three playthroughs** to guide players toward a specific narrative experience.
- The **second playthrough** shifts perspective to the other main character.

### Sentience & Software Instability
- The game is a sentient being, like others in the mirrored Earth world, but the first of its kind as a software entity.
- Software (in)stability is conveyed through **environmental storytelling and game elements**, not just dialogue.

### Setting & Historical Context
- The game is created in **The Tangerine Republic era** (2nd millennium onward).
- The **Division Conflict** (pre-industrial, pre-redevelopment period) is nearly **a thousand years before the game's creation** and is the setting for the story.
- The game has **no influence on the war** but exists to document it.

### Side Characters & Perspectives
- Side characters evolve less than the main protagonists.
- There are both **major NPCs with differing perspectives** and **personal acquaintances of the main characters.**

### Game's Frustration & Fourth Wall
- The game breaking the fourth wall is **not binary but a gradient** (becoming more unstable over time).
- The frustration mirrors how the user struggles to explain things.
- The game conveys **anti-war themes**, emphasizing that there are always losses in war, influenced by real-world conflicts (Russia-Ukraine, South China Sea, Middle East).
